<p>Less than two weeks after the last significant iOS 12 update — one which brought a wide variety of new features and changes to the platform — Apple has returned with a smaller (but no less necessary) update.

On Monday, Apple shared iOS 12.1.2, which addresses a bug relating to eSIM activation on the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, though there haven’t been any reports about eSIM issues to our knowledge. The update also includes a fix for “an issue that could affect cellular connectivity in Turkey” for all three 2018 iPhone models.</p>
