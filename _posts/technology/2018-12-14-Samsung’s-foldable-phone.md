<p>Samsung unveiled its first ever foldable smartphone last month, but it was hardly a proper announcement. Samsung showed off the phone’s Infinity Flex screen design, revealed the phone would have a large screen on the inside and a smaller one on the outside, and demoed bits and pieces of the new interface it developed with Google for the unnamed phone.</p>

<p>That’s about everything Samsung was willing to tell us about the phone, leaving plenty of things out of this first foldable phone presentation. However, a report that talks in great detail about the future of foldable devices also shares new information about Samsung’s new phone, including camera and battery specs.</p>
