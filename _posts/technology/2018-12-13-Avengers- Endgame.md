<p>The first trailer for Avengers 4 is out, and we know that Marvel settled on Avengers: Endgame as the official title of the fourth film in the Avengers series. Of course, we still have no idea how our favorite heroes will ultimately defeat Thanos. That said, Endgame is likely going to show us the one future that Doctor Strange saw, the one in which the Avengers prevailed over the titan. The fallen heroes, or at least most of them, will be resurrected. But what if “resurrected” isn’t the right word to use? What if nobody actually died in Infinity War when Thanos snapped his fingers?</p>
